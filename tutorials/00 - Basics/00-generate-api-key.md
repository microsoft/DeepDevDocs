# How to generate API key

Once you have been approved for beta access to the DeepDev site, you can access your API key from the `Your API key` dropdown item under `Settings` on the top right area of the navbar for the DeepDev website.

## Regenerate API Key

In that page, to generate a new API key simply press the `Generate new` button.

_Note: regenerating a new API key will invalidate the previous key. Make sure to update your applications._
