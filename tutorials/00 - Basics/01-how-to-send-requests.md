# Accessing the API playground

## Authentication

After generating an API key, you will now be able to access the DeepDev API playground which is accessible from the `API` left navbar item in the DeepDev website.

Navigate to the `Authentication` section in the left sidebar, and paste the API key into the `HTTP Bearer` field.

Finally, click the `SET` button to ensure that the API key is used for subsequent API operations.

## Using the API routes

Now that you are authenticated, you can access the API routes. For each endpoint, after filling out the appropriate parameters you can send the request by pressing the `TRY` button at the bottom of the expanded endpoint container.
