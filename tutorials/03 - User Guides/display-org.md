# Associating models with GitHub organization

Models you deploy will automatically include your currently selected organization. By default, when you sign up, your display organization will be public. You can change it easily by going to `Settings` -> `Your Profile`.

## My organization is not in the list

Only GitHub organizations that you have selected to show publicly will appear under `Your Profile`. To publicize a specific organization that you are a part of, see [Publicizing or hiding organization membership](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-your-membership-in-organizations/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership)
